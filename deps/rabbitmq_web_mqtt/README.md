## Installation

This plugin ships with modern versions of RabbitMQ.
Like all plugins, it [must be enabled](https://www.rabbitmq.com/plugins.html) before it can be used:

# this might require sudo
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_web_stomp
```

## Documentation

## Building From Source

 * [Generic plugin build instructions](https://www.rabbitmq.com/plugin-development.html)

when building plugins from source.

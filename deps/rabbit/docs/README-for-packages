This is rabbitmq-server, a message broker implementing AMQP 0-9-1, AMQP 1.0,
STOMP and MQTT.

Most of the documentation for RabbitMQ is provided on the RabbitMQ web
site. You can see documentation for the current version at

https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html

and for previous versions at

https://www.rabbitmq.com/previous.html

Man pages are installed with this package. Of particular interest are
rabbitmqctl(8), rabbitmq-diagnostics(8), rabbitmq-queues(8).
They interact with a running node. rabbitmq-plugins(8) is  used to manage plugins.
All of these should be run as the superuser. Learn more about
CLI tools at

An example configuration file is provided in the same directory as
this README. Copy it to /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf to use it. The
RabbitMQ server must be restarted after changing the configuration
file.  Learn more about configuration at

An example policy file for HA queues is provided in the same directory
as this README. Copy and chmod +x it to

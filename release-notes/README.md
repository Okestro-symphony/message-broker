# Release Notes

This directory contains the source of release notes starting with RabbitMQ `3.5.7`
as well as archived notes for earlier releases.

The notes are published together with releases [on GitHub](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases)
and most commonly discovered via the [change log page](https://rabbitmq.com/changelog.html).

This may include WIP notes for unreleased versions or preview releases.

## Archived Pre-GitHub Notes

This directory contains release notes for releases from `1.1.x` through `3.5.0`,
which pre-date the migration to GitHub. They are preserved both for historical
purposes and to keep the [change log](https://rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) links functional,
so their names were not modified to match the `X.Y.Z.md` pattern.

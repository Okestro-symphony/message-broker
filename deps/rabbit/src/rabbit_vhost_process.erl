%% This module implements a vhost identity process.

%% On start this process will try to recover the vhost data and
%% processes structure (queues and message stores).
%% If recovered successfully, the process will save it's PID
%% to vhost process registry. If vhost process PID is in the registry and the
%% process is alive - the vhost is considered running.

%% On termination, the ptocess will notify of vhost going down.

%% The process will also check periodically if the vhost still
%% present in mnesia DB and stop the vhost supervision tree when it
%% disappears.

%% Transitional step until we can require Erlang/OTP 21 and
